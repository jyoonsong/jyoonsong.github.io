**The cancellation rate** is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between `"2013-10-01"` and `"2013-10-03"`. **Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points**.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

- Solution 1
```sql
SELECT request_at Day
        ,ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled_by_driver' OR status = 'cancelled_by_client' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
         / (COUNT(id) * 1.00),2) 'Cancellation Rate' -- 여기서 1.00을 왜 곱하는 걸까?
FROM Trips
WHERE request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
AND client_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = 'No') --- 서브쿼리
AND driver_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = 'No') --- 서브쿼리
GROUP BY request_at;
```

- solution 2
```sql
SELECT request_at as Day, 
       ROUND(COUNT(CASE 
             WHEN status != 'completed' 
             THEN 1 
             ELSE NULL 
             END) / COUNT(*),2) 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips
INNER JOIN Users client ON client.users_id = Trips.client_id -- 이너조인1
INNER JOIN Users driver ON driver.users_id = Trips.driver_id -- 이너조인2
WHERE (client.banned = 'No' AND driver.banned = 'No') AND (request_at BETWEEN  "2013-10-01" AND "2013-10-03")
GROUP BY request_at
```

- solution 3
```sql
SELECT Request_at AS Day
      ,ROUND(SUM(IF(Status = 'completed', 0, 1))/COUNT(Status), 2) 'Cancellation Rate' 
FROM Trips 
WHERE Client_Id NOT IN (SELECT Users_Id FROM Users WHERE Banned = 'Yes') 
    AND Driver_Id NOT IN (SELECT Users_Id FROM Users WHERE Banned = 'Yes')
    AND Request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY Request_at;
```
