Write a solution to report the products that were only sold in the first quarter of ```2019```. That is, between ```2019-01-01``` and ```2019-03-31``` inclusive.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

단계별로 생각하고 쿼리를 짜자.

1. ```Product``` 테이블의 ```product_name```을 ```Sales``` 테이블에 붙인다.
2. ```Sales``` 테이블의 ```product_id```를 GROUP BY로 묶는다.
3. ```Sales``` 테이블의 ```sale_date```가 '2019-01-01' 와 '2019-03-31' 사이에만 있어야 하므로, ```MIN(Sales.sale_date) >= "2019-01-01" AND MAX(Sales.sale_date) <= "2019-03-31"```



```sql
SELECT p.product_id
      ,p.product_name
FROM Sales s
INNER JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id 
GROUP BY s.product_id
HAVING MIN(s.sale_date) >= "2019-01-01" AND MAX(s.sale_date) <= "2019-03-31";
  ```
